> **Explicit invocation only**: This skill should only run when the user explicitly requests it with `/launch-checklist`. Do not auto-invoke based on context matching.

## Phase 1: Parse Arguments

Read the argument for the launch date or `dry-run` mode. Dry-run mode generates the checklist without creating sign-off entries or writing files.

---

## Phase 2: Gather Project Context

- Read `CLAUDE.md` for tech stack, target platforms, and team structure
- Read the latest milestone in `production/milestones/`
- Read any existing release checklist in `production/releases/`

---

## Phase 3: Scan Codebase Health

- Count `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK` comments and their locations
- Check for any `console.log`, `print()`, or debug output left in production code
- Check for placeholder assets (search for `placeholder`, `temp_`, `WIP_`)
- Check for hardcoded test/dev values (localhost, test credentials, debug flags)

---

## Phase 4: Generate the Launch Checklist

```markdown
# Launch Checklist: [Game Title]
Target Launch: [Date or DRY RUN]
Generated: [Date]

---

## 1. Code Readiness

### Build Health
- [ ] Clean build on all target platforms
- [ ] Zero compiler warnings
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks within targets
- [ ] No memory leaks (verified via extended soak test)
- [ ] Build size within platform limits
- [ ] Build version correctly set and tagged in source control

### Code Quality
- [ ] TODO count: [N] (zero required for launch, or documented exceptions)
- [ ] FIXME count: [N] (zero required)
- [ ] HACK count: [N] (each must have documented justification)
- [ ] No debug output in production code
- [ ] No hardcoded dev/test values
- [ ] All feature flags set to production values
- [ ] Error handling covers all critical paths
- [ ] Crash reporting integrated and verified

---

## 2. Content Readiness

### Assets
- [ ] All placeholder art replaced with final assets
- [ ] All placeholder audio replaced with final audio
- [ ] Audio mix finalized and approved by audio director
- [ ] All VFX polished and performance-verified
- [ ] No missing or broken asset references
- [ ] Asset naming conventions enforced

### Game Content
- [ ] All levels/maps playable from start to finish
- [ ] Tutorial flow complete and tested with new players
- [ ] All achievements/trophies implemented and tested
- [ ] Save/load works correctly for all game states
- [ ] Difficulty settings balanced and tested
- [ ] End-game/credits sequence complete

---

## Go / No-Go Decision

**Overall Status**: [READY / NOT READY / CONDITIONAL]

### Blocking Items
[List any items that must be resolved before launch]

### Conditional Items
[List items that have documented workarounds or accepted risk]

### Sign-Offs Required
- [ ] Creative Director — Content and experience quality
- [ ] Technical Director — Technical health and stability
- [ ] Producer — Schedule and overall readiness
```

---

## Phase 5: Save Checklist

Present the completed checklist and summary to the user (total items, blocking items count, conditional items count, departments with incomplete sections).

If not in dry-run mode, ask: "May I write this to `production/releases/launch-checklist-[date].md`?"

If yes, write the file, creating directories as needed.

---

## Phase 6: Next Steps

- Run `/gate-check` to get a formal PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL verdict before launch.
- Coordinate sign-offs via `/team-release`.
